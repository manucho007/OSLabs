The main difference between physical and virtual addresses:
	1. Physical - are real addresses of main memory unit
	2. Virtual - are generated by MMU in run-time of the program. These virtual addresses are mapped to the physical ones during execution time.
Virtual addresses also contain additional information such as modified and referenced bits, present/absent bit, protection bits.
Virtual addresses can be accessed by users, while physical can not.
